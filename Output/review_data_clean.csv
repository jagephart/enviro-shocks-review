Nevertheless, there remains limited comparable evidence across multiple countries and regions regarding the global extent of climate shocks affecting smallholder food security. We examine data from 5,299 household surveys across 15 countries in Latin America, Africa and South Asia to assess the extent of climate shocks and their association with food insecurity, as well as what strategies may help buffer against climate shocks. We find that 71% of households reported experiencing a climate shock in the previous five years. Fifty-four percent reported experiencing food insecurity during one or more months annually. A multilevel statistical model estimated factors correlated with food insecurity as well as factors correlated with food insecurity among households that had experienced a climate shock. Households that reported experiencing a climate shock were 1.73 times more likely to be food insecure. As well, larger and poorer households were associated with higher odds of food insecurity while using pesticides, keeping large livestock, and being more educated are associated with lower odds of food insecurity. Among households that had experienced a climate shock, additional factors are correlated with lower odds of food insecurity when compared to otherwise similar households: use of fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary medicines, large livestock, and household assets. Together, these results demonstrate the extent of existing climate shocks affecting smallholder farmers and how interventions may potentially support adaptation and reduce food insecurity.","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","Food insecurity is measured as the total number of months in a typical year during which respondents reported not having adequate food for their household","No","","Household-reported climate related crisis"," (eg.

The study was initiated on the premise that Zimbabwe is at high risk and is highly vulnerable to disasters such as drought, cyclones, floods, animal diseases, and crop pests. This study employed a mixed method approach that involved the use of structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and observations. A combined total of 92 dairy farmers and milk processors were sampled from a target population of 122 from major milk producing regions in the country, with a response rate of 85%. Key informants, comprising 18 dairy authorities and 30 retailers were purposively sampled. Chipinge, Mutare, Harare, Gweru, and Bulawayo, were the regions under investigation, covering the greater part of the country. The findings computed through Ordinary Least Square regression analysis, indicated that an overall index of disaster risks impacted negatively on dairy supply chain performance. Major indicators of the disaster impacts were job losses, food insecurity, reduced milk productivity, and the general retarded growth in dairy businesses. The results were also corroborated by outcome of interviews with key informants. This study recommends that both the private sector and the government should invest in disaster reduction strategies, to enhance the effective and sustainable performance of dairy supply chains in Zimbabwe. The findings from the study contribute to literature on disaster risks, which has largely been under-explored in developing countries, will also assist practicing managers, particularly in dairy sector, in dealing with disaster risk issues. Similarly, the study findings will assist policy makers to consider enacting policies, and improve existing ones, to assist communities faced with disaster risks.","Jessica","","No","","Yes","Dairy farmers interviewed, but analysis doesn't appear to breakdown by stage","Yes","Dairy officers interviewed, but analysis doesn't appear to breakdown by stage","Yes","Dairy retailers interviewed, but analysis doesn't appear to breakdown by stage","No",NA,"No","","Yes","Food security is an outcome variable","No","","Disaster risk index","comprised of interest rates, influence from local giants, international competition, government policy, political influence, drought, cattle diseases, cyclones, extreme cold weather, feeds processing technology, power outages, milk technology and high labour and dairy breeding costs","n/a (risk study-- not looking at a specific event)","N","Interview key informants involved in the dairy supply chain about disaster risks.

When asked about events in the past 20 years, participants identified the 1997-98 El Nino as a major negative event. The El Nino disaster situation induced a decrease in access to transport and health care and the rise in infectious diseases was swiftly contained. Residents needed more time to rebuild housing; recover agriculture, livestock and income stability; and return to eating sufficient animal protein. Although large-scale assistance minimized effects of the disaster, residents needed more support.

In this paper, we quantify the potential dynamic impacts of such a disease on Brittany, a French region with an important livestock sector. In order to do this, we develop a dynamic computable general equilibrium model that allows us to measure the impacts on the livestock sectors and downstream food industries. We study the impacts of a FMD outbreak including the culling infected animals, a temporary decline in demand, and restrictions on movements of live animals and meats during the FMD outbreak period. Our results show that economic losses following this disease are spread over many periods even with a one-time shock. We also find that the impacts on the various primary sectors and downstream food sectors are quite different, depending on their initial trade position. Our general equilibrium results show the great incidence of potential constraints affecting factor markets. Capital and wage constraints severely increase the aggregate costs of such disease. These results challenge the definition of a simple efficient management policy for this disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use annual staple food production and trade data from 1992-2009 to analyse the changing properties of the global food system. Over the 18 year study period, we show that the global food system is relatively homogeneous (85% of countries have low or marginal food self-sufficiency) and increases in complexity, with the number of global wheat and rice trade connections doubling and trade flows increasing by 42 and 90%, respectively. The increased connectivity and flows within these global trade networks suggest that the global food system is vulnerable to systemic disruptions, especially considering the tendency for exporting countries to switch to non-exporting states during times of food scarcity in the global markets. To test this hypothesis, we superimpose continental-scale disruptions on the wheat and rice trade networks. We find greater absolute reductions in global wheat and rice exports along with larger losses in network connectivity as the networks evolve due to disruptions in European wheat and Asian rice production. Importantly, our findings indicate that least developed countries suffer greater import losses in more connected networks through their increased dependence on imports for staple foods (due to these large-scale disturbances): mean (median) wheat losses as percentages of staple food supply are 8.9% (3.8%) for 1992-1996, increasing to 11% (5.7%) for 2005-2009. Over the same intervals, rice losses increase from 8.2% (2.2%) to 14% (5.2%). Our work indicates that policy efforts should focus on balancing the efficiency of international trade (and its associated specialization) with increased resilience of domestic production and global demand diversity.","Jessica","Staple crops","No","","Yes","","No","n/a","No","n/a","Yes",NA,"No","n/a","Yes","Sort of implied with supply metric","No","","Simulated shock","","n/a","Y (propagation among countries, not along the supply chain stages)","Simulated shock propagation on trade networks based on network properties","Quantitative","National stable crop supply","Global","International","1992-2009","N","","",6,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Multi-regional"
"7","Can Global Climate Change affect Prices in the World Banana Market?","German Journal of Agricultural Economics","1/1/18",NA,0,"This paper explores the potential impacts of extreme weather events associated with climate change on prices in the international banana market. First, we made an inventory of the events reported to have affected banana export volumes for six exporter countries, as well as events reported to have affected banana import prices in the French market, between the years 2000 to 2015. We used weekly time-series to examine the impact of reported events on banana export volumes and on banana import prices. The first results indicate that weather events were the most frequently reported events to impact on export volumes and on consumer demand, thus confirming that they play a frequent role in determining prices. However, we also identified a wide range of other non weather events which affect volumes, consumer demand and thus prices. We demonstrated that the extent to which extreme weather events affect prices is primarily determined by the coincidence of events and by the structural context of the exporting and importing countries. This study helps to put the potential impact of weather events related to climate change into perspective and highlights the ongoing role of market mechanisms, policy makers and stakeholders' strategies in price variations in international commodity markets.","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","Multiple shocks, including climatic, geopolitical, logistic, social causes","","Multiple shock events","Y","Cross-correlated events affecting banana exports with weekly banana prices","Quantitative","Export quantities and import prices","France (plus exports from Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guadeloupe, Ivory Coast and Cameroon)","National","1999-2015","N","","Kyle requested and emailed pdf",7,"Fruits & Vegetables","N","Multi-regional"

Results of a survey of food systems and household adaptation strategies in three communities in the Afram Plains, Ghana, reveal how extreme climatic events affect rural food production, transportation, processing and storage. Adaptation strategies implemented by the three communities during past droughts serve as a foundation for planning responses to future climate change. Results of this study suggest that food security in this region-where droughts and floods are expected to become more severe due to climate change-could be enhanced by increasing farm-based storage facilities; improving the transportation system, especially feeder roads that link food production areas and major markets; providing farmers with early warning systems; extending credit to farmers; and the use of supplementary irrigation. This study also indicates that some cultural practices, particularly those that prohibit the consumption of certain foods, may reduce the resilience of some individuals and ethnic groups to food system disruptions. Understanding the local context and the responses of households is critical to the development of effective strategies for reducing the potential adverse impacts of climatic change on food security in rural Ghana.","Jessica","","No","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","No specific shock (a risk analysis)","","n/a","N","Household surveys about percerceptions of rclimate change risks and adapatation","Qualitative","Perceptions of risk and change","Three communities in the African Plains region of Ghana","Sub-national","2008","N","","",8,"Not specific","N","Africa"

Many studies have analyzed agricultural market instability from different points of view, but the effect of climate oscillations on agricultural price volatility has been little studied. Climate anomalies, and in particular extreme events, can alter agricultural yields and stocks with related effects on prices. This paper presents a Volatility Impulse Response Function (VIRF) from a multivariate GARCH model to investigate the effects of variability in climatic shocks (El Nino/Southern Oscillation - ENSO) on international maize and soybean price volatility from 1960 to 2014. For both commodities, VIRF analysis was conducted splitting the effect of El Nino and La Nina events according to Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter meteorological seasons. Both events increase expected price volatility of maize, showing the strongest impact during the El Nino phase in Spring-Summer. Soybean price volatility tends to slightly decrease during Autumn-Winter meteorological seasons and to increase during the Spring-Summer period. To minimize the impact of ENSO events on commodity price volatility, various measures can be taken, both political and technical. Financial aspects should also be considered. It is possible that financial agents can use the ENSO index as information for trading activity, creating a new link between this index and volatility in commodity prices.","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","El Nino","","Multiple (ENSO years)","N","Time series econometric approach to looking at ENSO event impacts on price volatility","Quantitative","Price volatility","Global","International","1960-2014","N","","",9,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Multi-regional"

These supply chains are increasingly exposed to the impacts of a changing climate, yet receive little attention relative to the study of the production phase. Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate- related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries - fisheries, agriculture and mining - that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices - evenness, resilience, continuity of supply and climate resilience - to estimate the performance of simple and complex supply chains in each industry. As with ecological systems, we show that complex supply chains with a large number of nodes and links are more resilient to disruption. Critically, all chains, regardless of their complexity, will have diminished resilience as climate disruptions become more frequent. This highlights the importance of considering the broader economic benefits of diversified chains, leading to risk reduction and improved design post-disruption. It also reinforces the importance of a systems approach to risk management in supply chains, particularly in considering adaptation options for addressing direct and indirect impacts on. the chain as well as the global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Jessica","","No","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","No",NA,"Yes","","Yes","","No","","Hypothetical","","n/a","Y","Map supply chains and simulate effects of shocks on them","Mixed","Resilience score","Australia","National","","N","","",10,"Seafood","N","Oceania"

Although the frequency and severity of drought and heat extremes increase substantially in range of future climate scenarios by five Earth System Models, the vulnerability of beer supply to such extremes has never been assessed. We couple a process-based crop model (decision support system for agrotechnology transfer) and a global economic model (Global Trade Analysis Project model) to evaluate the effects of concurrent drought and heat extremes projected under a range of future climate scenarios. We find that these extreme events may cause substantial decreases in barley yields worldwide. Average yield losses range from 3% to 17% depending on the severity of the conditions. Decreases in the global supply of barley lead to proportionally larger decreases in barley used to make beer and ultimately result in dramatic regional decreases in beer consumption (for example, -32% in Argentina) and increases in beer prices (for example, +193% in Ireland).

This article investigates the loss and damage from the tundi droughts that occurred in 2004 and 2010 in the Sahel Region. The study conducted field survey among households in ten villages. We found that people's reliance on transhumance has been decreasing over the last decades due to the lack of good pastures, competition over natural resources and corollary conflicts. Whereas transhumance was an effective way to deal with droughts and seasonality, decreased mobility and increased interdependence between cattle and crop production has made people more vulnerable in the event of extreme droughts. Evidences from the survey results show that the vast majority of the respondents experienced negative effects of recent tundi droughts on crops (96%) and livestock (87%). It is also found that such extreme droughts tend to have a cascading impact; they first cause a lack of water affecting seedling and crop yields, which then affects the availability of food for people and feed for livestock. This, in turn, further limits their capacity to cope with future droughts.","Jessica","","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","","Drought","","2004, 2010","N","Household surveys in 10 villages on livelihoods and vulnerability, the impacts of and coping with weather-related extreme events","Qualitative","Self-reported impacts on production, prices and livelihoods","northern region of Burkina Faso","Sub-national","Unclear when surveys were conducted","N","","",12,"Not specific","N","Africa"

A previous study, focused on Niamey (Niger) with 'hunger' and 'normal' seasons modelled as a latent Markov process, found that in the last two decades the risk of food crises has tended to spread over longer periods and to shift forward in timing. To help better devise support programmes, it would be beneficial to test for this finding in other locations in Africa and extend the focus beyond conditional mean analysis. This paper first reviews measures of food insecurity/crisis risk, and considers determinants of spatial and temporal food price variability in drought-prone countries. Duration-dependent Markov-switching VAR models are then formulated and applied to monthly staple prices of food markets in Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia. This is complemented with multivariate GARCH models of volatility and dynamic correlations of food price shocks in major urban centres of five Sahel countries. In Niger, seasonal shocks in surplus-producing regions often anticipate by nearly 1 month those in deficit regions. 'Steep' regime probability switches are of concern especially in recent years. However, across semi-arid countries in East and West Africa, no systematic variation over time was detected in terms of onset and length of seasonal food insecurity periods, nor between seasons relative to food price volatility.","Jessica","Original items: Staple crops; crops listed in 'Food Item(s)' were those staple crops mentioned in the study text","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","Drought","","n/a","N","Time series econometric approach","Quantitative","Seasonal impact on staple crop price","Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia","National","1990-2010","N","","Kyle requested and emailed pdf",14,"Other cereals","N","Africa"

Models can help us gain insights into trade network dynamics and predict how they might respond to future disturbances such as extreme weather events. Here we develop a preferential attachment (PA) network model of the global wheat trade network. We find that the PA model can replicate the time evolution of crucial wheat trade network metrics from 1986 to 2011. We use the calibrated PA model to predict the response of wheat trade network metrics to shocks of differing length and severity, including both attacks (outward edge removal on high degree nodes) and errors (outward edge removal on randomly selected nodes). We predict that the network will become less vulnerable to attacks but will continue to exhibit low resilience until 2050. Even short-term shocks strongly increase link diversity and cause long-term structural changes that influence the network's response to subsequent shocks. Attacks have a greater impact than errors. However, with repeated attacks, each attack has a lesser impact than the previous attack. We conclude that dynamic models of multi-annual, commodity-specific networks should be further developed to gain insight into possible futures of global agri-food trade networks.","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","No","","Simulated","","N/A","Y (propagation among countries, not along the supply chain stages)","Simulated shock with a preferential attachment model","Quantitative","Network metrics of resilience to shocks","Global","International","1986-2011","N","","",16,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Multi-regional"

The study aims to assess the magnitude of the impact as well as highlight key issues that can inform the implementation of drought mitigation programmes. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents the literature on the economic impact of drought and uses a computable general equilibrium model where productivity shocks are applied to the agricultural industries following which the resulting impacts on the rest of the sectors of the economy are obtained. Findings The findings show that the key macroeconomic variables, namely, real GDP, industry output, employment, the trade balance and household consumption are negatively affected by the drought shock. Practical implications The results point to the fact that in the absence of drought mitigation mechanisms, the occurrence of even a short drought as modelled in this paper can impose substantial socioeconomic losses. Originality/value First, a general equilibrium framework which uses climate and economic data when evaluating the social-economic impacts of drought is used. Most studies employ partial equilibrium analysis in analysing drought impacts on specific sectors or crops within a limited geographical area. Others use global or multi-regional models which impose averages on the observed impacts. The current study provides valuable insights on the potential damage which droughts can impose on a single economy.

Objectives: To examine the relationship between living arrangements and dietary intake using the data of a large-scale cohort survey of evacuees after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Methods: 73,433 residents in evacuation zones responded to the Fukushima Health Management Survey questionnaire. Subjects were excluded if they did not report their living conditions or were missing more than three pieces of information about dietary intake. The data of 52,314 subjects (23,149 men and 29,165 women >= 15 years old) were used for the analyses. Evacuees' living arrangements were characterized into three categories: evacuation shelters or temporary housing, rental houses or apartments, or a relative's home or their own home. Dietary intake was characterized in terms of grains, fruits and vegetables, meat, soybean products, dairy products, and fish. Daily consumption of the third quartile (Q3) or higher for each food group was defined as `high consumption'. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using modified Poisson regression analyses. Results: Modified Poisson regression analyses showed that, compared with respondents living in a relative's home or their own home, the PRs and 95% CIs for the people living in rental apartments of high consumption of fruits and vegetables (non-juice), meat, soybean products, and dairy products were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.61e-0.77), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.94), and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.93) respectively. The corresponding PRs and 95% CIs for people living in evacuation shelters or temporary housing were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.88), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.86-0.95), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.97), and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86-0.96) for high consumption of fruits and vegetables (non-juice), meat, soybean products, and dairy products, respectively. Conclusion: The present study suggests that, after the earthquake, living in non-home conditions was associated with poor dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (non-juice), meat, soybean products, and dairy products and suggesting the need for early improvements in the provision of balanced meals among evacuees living in non-home conditions (S) 2016 The Authors Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the japan Epidermiological Association","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","survey of dietary intake","No","","Tsunami","","2011","N","Food frequency questionaire","Qualitative","Change in dietary intake following the tsunami","Japan","Sub-national","2012","N","","",21,"Not specific","N","Asia"

The hypothesis of this paper is that rainfall patterns impact changes in income within our study region of central and northern Mozambique. Utilizing satellite-based estimates of rainfall analyzed within a GIS, we establish a 12-year rainfall climatology and calculate monthly rainfall anomalies for 419 villages during three growing seasons. We also approximate storm-total rainfall from tropical cyclones entering the Mozambique Channel. Hierarchical cluster analysis groups the villages according to the monthly rainfall anomalies and rainfall received from Cyclones Delfina and Japhet. Then, using data from the National Agricultural Survey of Mozambique conducted in 2002 and 2005, we relate rainfall and change in income through the calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients and independent-samples t tests using village-groups produced by the cluster analysis. We find that no season closely approximates the 12-year climatology and that rainfall varied among the three seasons. Although most villages experience income declines, those affected by Delfina exhibit the worst economic performance, indicating that heavy rainfall from some tropical cyclones can have long-lasting negative effects on income. Additionally, receiving above-normal rainfall may hinder economic well-being more than below-normal rainfall. Our study identifies patterns in sub-national rainfall variability and economic well-being that enable a more detailed understanding of weather-related effects on socio-economic outcomes.","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","Partially through income","No","","Drought, two tropical cyclones","","2002-2005 (Drought) 2002 & 2003 (Cyclones)","N","Correlation and custer analysis looking at income response to precipitation","Quantitative","Income (which represents the sum of income from agricultural crop and livestock production, agricultural wage labor, nonagricultural wage labor, non-agricultural self-employment, sale of natural resources, and pensions and remittances)","Mozambique","National","1998-2009","N","","Outcome is effect of precip on income",22,"Not specific","N","Africa"

We studied the role of autonomous adaptation by farmers and through markets as embodied in a computable general equilibrium model. The results show that observed extreme impacts of precipitation on crop harvests are not serious for China at national level. The maize harvest is the most negatively affected with a reduction of 4 % without adaptation and less than 1 % reduction with adaptation. However, the impacts within a province may be serious and even become worse with adaptation. Good harvests might not make farmers better off due to lower crop prices even though consumers benefit.

We show that some regions are shock hotspots, exposed frequently to shocks across multiple sectors. Critically, shock frequency has increased through time on land and sea at a global scale. Geopolitical and extreme-weather events were the main shock drivers identified, but with considerable differences across sectors. We illustrate how social and ecological drivers, influenced by the dynamics of the food system, can spill over multiple food sectors and create synchronous challenges or trade-offs among terrestrial and aquatic systems.

Climate variability and climate change can affect all aspects of food security, but past impact assessments have focused primarily on agricultural production. Efficient responses require an understanding of the full spectrum of potential climate impacts on food utilization, access and availability, as well as on the underlying natural, built and governance systems. In this paper, we apply a broader systems approach to evaluating food systems resilience in the context of climate change (Bizikova, Tyler, Moench, Keller, & Echeverria, 2015) to 10 communities in Honduras. The results indicate that resilience building depends on a sound understanding of how communities access food and how climate impacts can cascade through different parts of the food system. Key support systems, such as natural resources, storage, transportation and energy have to be strengthened, and local governance has to be preserved and improved.

Were there to be a major epidemic that severely reduced yields, its effects would spread throughout the globalized food system. To explore these ramifications, we use a partial equilibrium economic model of the global food system ( IMPACT) to study a hypothetical severe but short-lived epidemic that reduces rice yields in the countries affected by 80%. We modelled a succession of epidemic scenarios of increasing severity, starting with the disease in a single country in southeast Asia and ending with the pathogen present in most of eastern Asia. The epidemic and subsequent crop losses led to substantially increased global rice prices. However, as long as global commodity trade was unrestricted and able to respond fast enough, the effects on individual calorie consumption were, to a large part, mitigated. Some of the worse effects were projected to be experienced by poor net-rice importing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which were not affected directly by the disease but suffered because of higher rice prices. We critique the assumptions of our models and explore political economic pressures to restrict trade at times of crisis. We finish by arguing for the importance of 'stress-testing' the resilience of the global food system to crop disease and other shocks.

The virtual displacement of the water used to produce such goods (known as virtual water) connects together, in a global water system, all countries participating to the international trade network. Local food-production crises, having social, economic or environmental origin, propagate in this network, modifying the virtual water trade and perturbing local and global food availability, quantified in terms of virtual water. We analyze here the possible effects of local crises by developing a new propagation model, parsimonious but grounded on data-based and statistically-verified assumptions, whose effectiveness is proved on the Argentinean crisis in 2008-09. The model serves as the basis to propose indicators of crisis impact and country vulnerability to external food-production crises, which highlight that countries with largest water resources have the highest impact on the international trade, and that not only water-scarce but also wealthy and globalized countries are among the most vulnerable to external crises.

However, during the last decade the availability of RUK grain exports was repeatedly diminished by harvest failures and further reduced by the introduction of export restrictions. By simulating a reoccurrence of the 2010 RUK harvest situation this paper assesses the impact of grain harvest failures and subsequent temporary export restrictions (bans, quotas, taxes) on national and international food security, specifically quantifying the effects on agricultural market prices and quantities. For the analysis AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model, has been employed. Simulation results highlight the importance of RUK's grain production for world markets and global food security, indicating substantial price increases due to limited grain exports from RUK. Moreover, scenario results illustrate that temporary RUK export restrictions can considerably aggravate the situation on world grain markets, with particularly adverse effects for grain net importing countries. At the same time, results show that for a country like Ukraine, i.e. a country usually exporting large shares of its total grain production, the introduction of export restrictions could potentially result in decreases of domestic consumer prices to a level even below a situation with normal weather conditions. The results put international trade policy into focus and underline the necessity of greater cooperation on the part of exporting countries in order to avoid importing countries being denied necessary grain supplies.","Shauna","Original: Cereals (wheat, course grains)","Yes","feed","Yes","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","Drought","","2015","Yes","A recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model simulating the reoccurence of the 2010 RUK harvest failures","Quantitative","Grain availability, price and food security","Russia, Ukraine and Khazakstan","International","2011-2021","N","","Examines different policy scenarios of export bans, taxes, etc.",34,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Europe"

Given the persistence of significant undernourishment despite regional development efforts, this paper attempts to analyse and explain food insecurity in the Puno region in terms of food availability and food sovereignty. The purpose was to estimate the per capita caloric nutritional coverage and to determine the percentage contribution of food groups to the caloric availability in different climate change situations (normal, flood, drought), based on the Food Balance Sheet developed by FAO. Official information mainly from the Direccion Regional Agraria de Puno was used. The analysis revealed that the productive potential for food security and sovereignty of the Puno region depends mostly on climatic behavior, which becomes very critical during the last years. The caloric nutritional coverage in the Puno region during a climatologically normal year, reaches only 60% of the theoretical caloric needs of one person per day, with a caloric deficit of 40%. Even more, a year with excessive rainfalls generates a food calories dependence of 60%, while a year of drought generates 87%. The food groups that contribute most to the caloric availability are tubers, cereals and red meats. However, the proportions of the supply vary substantially according to the particular behavior of rainfalls, either in a normal year, with excessive rainfalls and/or in a drought situation. Results revealed a deficit of 1,000kcal per capita per day in the Puno region even during normal years (750mm of water layer), which can be resolved in a great part doubling the regional production of potato and quinoa, achieving a nutritional coverage of 95% of the nutritional requirements. These results must be considered to implement public policies focused in redress the caloric imbalance and adaptation to climate change in the Puno region.","Shauna","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","ish","No","","Drought, flood","","Drought (1992) and flood (2001)","No","Used food balance sheets to look at food availability in years of shocks as well as good years","Quantitative","Per capita caloric availability (using FAO data), %age contribution of food groups to caloric availability","Peru","National","1992-2009","N","Just using FAO data during years of shocks","",35,"Not specific","N","South America"

There is debate over the extent to which food price increases in 2008 eroded food security, the extent to which this effect was distributed across rural and urban locales, and the extent to which rural farmers might have benefited. Ethiopia's food prices increased particularly dramatically between 2005 and 2008 and here we ask whether there was a concomitant increase in household food insecurity, whether this decline was distributed equally across rural, urban, and semi-urban locales, and to what extent pre-crisis household capacities and vulnerabilities impacted 2008 household food insecurity levels. Data are drawn from a random sample of 2610 households in Southwest Ethiopia surveyed 2005/6 and again in mid to late 2008. Results show broad deterioration of household food insecurity relative to baseline but declines were most pronounced in the rural areas. Wealthier households and those that were relatively more food secure in 2005/6 tended to be more food secure in 2008, net of other factors, and these effects were most pronounced in urban areas. External shocks, such as a job loss or loss of crops, experienced by households were also associated with worse food insecurity in 2008 but few other household variables were associated with 2008 food insecurity. Our results also showed that rural farmers tended to produce small amounts for sale on markets, and thus were not able to enjoy the potential benefits that come from greater crop prices. We conclude that poverty, and not urban/rural difference, is the important variable for understanding the risk of food insecurity during a food crisis and that many rural farmers are too poor to take advantage of rapid rises in food prices.

But could other variables be important in understanding household vulnerability to food price shocks? This analysis uses survey data collected from 11 cities in Southern Africa by the African Food Security Urban Network during the 2008 food price crisis. As expected, the data show that household income is a significant predictor of the negative impact of rising food prices on household food security. However, other variables are significant predictors of household vulnerability to food insecurity as a result of food price increases. The analysis demonstrated how these diverse variables facilitated our classification of different households according to food price shocks using a CHAID decision tree. Demonstrating that household income is not the only significant predictor of household vulnerability to food price volatility, these findings broaden our understanding of the complex factors that can predispose households to food insecurity in the context of rising food prices.","Shauna","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","","Price Spike","","2008","No","Survey data from 11 cities in 9 Southern Africa countries","Qualitative","Food access and household food insecurity","Southern Africa (9 countries)","Sub-national","2008","N","","",37,"Not specific","N","Africa"

It uses an integrated method comprising of a stochastic method and a computable general equilibrium model using the latest (2010) input-output table published in 2015. The stochastic method, which relates to the Monte Carlo simulation, provides the probable changes in rainfall and temperature patterns and their probability of occurrence based on historical data of rainfall and temperature and crop productivity. It was found that, simultaneous variation of rainfall and temperature, in both the short- and long-run, contracts the economic performance of Malaysia. Findings also show the negative impact of rainfall-temperature variability, in both time periods, on food availability and access to food due to a reduction in the supply of agricultural products, a commodity inflation pressure and a reduction in household income. Moreover, results suggest that the climate variability shocks lead to a reduction in the consumption and welfare of all household groups, particularly in rural areas.","Shauna","","Yes","","Yes","","No","","Yes","","Yes",NA,"No","","No","Food expenditure only","Yes","","Variability in rainfall, temperature variability","","na","No","CGE model to examine different to examine porobably changes in rainfall and temperature based on historical data: average scenario, best scenario, worst scenario)","Quantitative","macroeconomic, agriculture and food access impacts","Malaysia","National","","N","I'm not sure it's really a shock.

The study applies an agent-based modelling approach to highlight the role of coping and adaptation strategies under climate and price variability. Our simulation results show that climate and price variability adversely affects income and food security of households in both countries. Self-coping mechanisms are found to be important but insufficient to mitigate the adverse effects of variability, implying the need for policy interventions. Adaptation strategies composed of a portfolio of actions such as the provision of production credit and access to improved seeds are found to be effective in reducing the impacts of climate and price variability in Ethiopia. Similarly, policy interventions aimed at improving the provision of short-term production credit along with the existing irrigation facilities are important in Ghana. Finally, this study highlights the importance of capturing the distributional aspects of adaptation options by highlighting heterogeneous effects of variability and adaptation options.

In this regard, present study was conducted in Southern Punjab to explore the impacts of flood on livelihoods and food security of rural communities. District Muzaffargarh was the major flood affected area of Punjab and was selected as study area. Total 120 flood affected people were interviewed for the sake of data collection. Data were collected through interview schedule and later on were analyzed with the help of computer software SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). The findings revealed that agriculture was the major income source of the area and flood affected the natural capitals (land, irrigation, orchards and livestock) pushing the income generating sources into darkness. These situations made the people food deficit and food insecure as they had to use contaminated commodities especially water. Generally that disaster pushed the farmers' prosperity to several years back. Integration of public and private sector along with NGO'S and national and international funding agencies can help to gain their resilience. Furthermore, establishment of early warning system and capacity building of flood victims will be helpful to cope with disasters. These actions should be established in the flood prone areas of entire country.","Shauna","","Yes","feed shortages","Yes","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","Food security?

Second, natural resources and informal social capital somewhat counteract this reduction and sustain dietary requirements. In general, our findings suggest the promotion of informal social capital and natural resources as they are cheaper and more accessible coping strategies, in comparison to, for example, insurance, which remains unaffordable in most rural parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

The impact of these spikes in world food prices on local food prices and thus on local consumers is determined by the food price pass through. Pass through is defined as the extent to which changes in world food prices lead to changes in local food prices. We examine the determinants of variation in food price pass through from global to local consumer prices in a global sample of 147 countries, using FAO data on world food prices and ILO data on food prices for consumers. While market integration matters, our study finds that income per capita is the dominant factor explaining cross-country variation in pass through of food prices. We estimate an elasticity of about 0.3 of pass through with respect to income per capita. This means far greater price transmission of food price shocks at the commodity level to final consumers in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The implication is that future swings in world food prices will in particular jeopardize food security in poor countries. Trade policy measures of market integration also affect the pass through significantly, whereas infrastructure and geography measures play no significant role. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It also assesses the impacts of food price increases on various household groups. Taking the 2007-2008 global food crisis as an example, we show that prices for domestic grain products are highly correlated with world market prices. This is true both for products for which Ghana is highly import-dependent (e.g., rice) and the products for which Ghana is self-sufficient (e.g., maize). The econometric results also show that price transmission is high between regional producer markets and markets located in the country's largest cities, and the distance between producer and consumer markets and the size of consumer markets matter in explaining the price transmission. The welfare analysis for households as consumers shows that the effect of world food prices appears relatively modest for the country as a whole due to relatively diverse consumption patterns within country. However, the national average hides important regional differences, both between regions and within different income groups. We find that the poorest of the poor-particularly those living in the urban areas-are hardest hit by high food prices. The negative effect of the food crisis is particularly strong in northern Ghana. The main explanations for this regional variation in the price effect is the different consumption patterns and much lower per capita income levels in the North of Ghana compared to other regions in the country.

This study investigated loss and damage from floods and droughts among rural households living near the Limpopo, Zambezi and Save rivers in Mozambique. We used a questionnaire survey (n = 303) and qualitative research tools. The study showed that farmers in the research areas were caught between two evils. In the uplands, conditions for agriculture are extremely poor and crop yields are low; moreover, farmers face considerable risk of crop failure when drought hits. In the lowlands, close to the river, soil and water conditions are more favourable, but these areas experience frequent floods. Evidence from this study shows that farmers in the research areas are severely affected by both floods and droughts, and their capacity to cope and adapt is limited. With very little livelihood diversification and poor access to markets, crop failures translate almost directly into severe food insecurity among the population.","Shauna","","No","","Yes","(just mentions that it affects production)","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","(mentions influences food prices)","Floods, drought","","Between 1992-2012","No","Survey questionnaire (n=303) and interviews and focus group discussions","Qualitative","Impacts of shocks","4 districts in Limpopo, Zambezi and Save rivers areas, Mozambique","Sub-national","doesn't mention","N","","Pretty qualitative.

Cointegration and error correction models were employed to analyze the degree of price transmission. Tests of causality were also performed. In general, the results showed that grain markets in Niger respond to negative and positive shocks in regional and international markets differently. Maize and rice markets have high speed of adjustments to world prices compared to millet and sorghum markets. The speed of adjustment of prices to the long-run equilibrium varies between 30 percent, 35 percent, 48 percent and 40 percent respectively for millet, sorghum, maize and rice prices. Nigeria, Burkina-Faso, Mali, Togo and Vietnam markets have shown significant transmission in Niger markets. Supply and demand shocks in these markets will definitely affect Niger food prices. Based on this analysis, we suggest that Niger should develop a proper trade policy with its neighboring countries to facilitate regional market integration. This will enable Niger to import cereals from regional surplus-producing areas to supply its food shock regions to reduce the negative impacts of price shocks on households. For rice, Niger should encourage local production to limit high dependence on international markets.","Shauna","","No","","Yes","(talks about how production changes due to seasonality influence the prices)","No","","Yes","(mentions transportation)","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","No specific shock","","na","Yes","Cointegration models to analyze price transmissions using monthly wholesale prices from FAO","Quantitative","Price transmission","Niger","National","2006-2012","N","","Doesnt actually mention a shock or climate.

From 2006 to 2008, there were sharp increases in the prices of major food commodities globally, including maize, rice, and wheat. Few studies have contributed empirical evidence of the nutritional impacts of this food price crisis. Objective. To assess changes in energy intake in response to food price shocks and in relation to calorie adequacy levels in seven Latin American countries. Methods. Data were drawn from nationally representative household budget surveys. The quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS) model characterized change patterns in consumption for six food groups and one nonfood group under two scenarios: actual change in food prices by country, and standardized 10% increase in prices across all countries. Energy intakes before and after the crisis were determined once calories were assigned to food items from the ProPAN and US Department of Agriculture food composition databases. Results. Energy intakes were reduced by 8.0% (range, 0.95% to 15.1%) from precrisis levels across all countries. Ecuador and Panama were the worst affected, followed by Haiti and Nicaragua. There was a consistent, direct relationship between wealth quintile and change in energy intake. Rural areas were affected to the same extent as or a greater extent than urban areas. High positive increases in calorie consumption were found in the richest wealth quintile, exceeding 10% of previous levels in five countries. Conclusions. Policies and programs targeting the poorest households in both rural and urban areas may be needed to offset the energy deficits associated with food price increases.

The post-earthquake nutrition and food security situation in the hardest hit areas remains uncertain. Methods Two national cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2014 and 2016 among households (HH) with pre-school aged children or newly married women. Of the 21 village development committees (VDCs) included in this sample, 7 fell within ""earthquake-affected"" areas. This paper presents data from 982 HH, 1015 women, and 883 children from 2014 and 1056 HH, 1083 women, and 998 children from 2016 living in these areas, with longitudinal overlap of about 55%. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and logistic regression was used to calculate p-values, both using robust estimates of standard errors to account for clustering. Results From 2014 to 2016, child wasting (weight-for-height z score <-2) fell from 4.5% (95% CI 3.3%- 6.1%) to 2.1% (1.4%- 3.1%) and food insecurity (assessed using the household food insecurity access scale) dropped from 17.6% (11.7%- 25.6%) to 12.4% (6.9%- 21.2%). Child stunting prevalence remained similar at both time-points. Improvements were also evident in dietary diversity and breastfeeding indicators.

Scholars sought to chart the impacts of the crisis on food insecurity by conducting simulation studies, assessing anthropometric outcomes, and evaluating shifts in experience-based measures of food security. Few studies, however, have investigated the broader impacts on those most vulnerable and how rapid rises in food prices play out in the everyday lives of those most impacted. We used qualitative methods to investigate the impact of the rise in food prices on the urban poor in Ethiopia. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted in August 2011, in the provincial town of jimma. Themes identified in these interviews included coping strategies, consumption priorities, and impacts on institutional networks of sharing. Our results suggest that several important cultural practices, including funerals and coffee ceremonies, were undermined by the rise in prices, and that respondents linked food prices to increasing food insecurity, which they in turn linked to high levels of stress, poor mental health, and reduced physical health. Our results are consistent with several other studies that suggest that food insecurity has a range of non-nutritional consequences, and that these are due in part to the highly social nature of food. Recognizing the effects of food insecurity on dimensions of everyday life such as interaction with neighbors, and feelings of shame, draws attention to the potential for food price increases to have erosive effects on communal social capital, and to increase the vulnerability of affected peoples to future shocks.

This paper introduces a model that simulates the short-term response to a food supply shock originating in a single country, which is partly absorbed through decreases in domestic reserves and consumption, and partly transmitted through the adjustment of trade flows. By applying the model to publicly-available data for the cereals commodity group over a 17 year period, we find that differential outcomes of supply shocks simulated through this time period are driven not only by the intensification of trade, but as importantly by changes in the distribution of reserves. Our analysis also identifies countries where trade dependency may accentuate the risk of food shortages from foreign production shocks; such risk could be reduced by increasing domestic reserves or importing food from a diversity of suppliers that possess their own reserves. This simulation-based model provides a framework to study the short-term, nonlinear and out-of-equilibrium response of trade networks to supply shocks, and could be applied to specific scenarios of environmental or economic perturbations.","Shauna","Original: Cereals and cereal products","No","","Yes","","Yes","(reserves)","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","Indirectly (check with Jessica)","Simulate a shock","Production shock (20%)","na","Yes","Model simulating the impact of a shock of a specific food commodity to global trade to examine tapping into reserves using historical data on the international trade of cereals","Quantitative","Transmission of shock through trade networks","Global","International","1994-2011","N","","No mention of climate",52,"Other cereals","N","Multi-regional"

Numerous arguments have been proposed to explain overshooting, including financial speculation, depreciation of the United States (US) dollar, low interest rates, and reductions in grain stocks. However, observations that international rice prices surged in response to export restrictions by India and Vietnam suggested that trade-related factors could be an important basis for overshooting, especially given the very tangible link between export volumes and export prices. In this paper, we revisit the trade story by closely examining monthly data from Thailand (the largest exporter of rice), and the United States (the largest exporter of wheat and maize and the third largest exporter of soybeans). In all cases except soybeans, we find that large surges in export volumes preceded the price surges. The presence of these large demand surges, together with back-of-the-envelope estimates of their price impacts, suggests that trade events played a much larger and more pervasive role than previously thought.

We find that: (i) income per capita of importing countries is relevant in shock propagation; (ii) developing countries tend to absorb most of the negative export variation (i.e., the trade shock), and (iii) global food prices and real (tonnes) flows of commodities are only weakly correlated, meaning that a quantity-based investigation provides additional information with respect to a price-based analysis. This work offers a novel frame-work, complementary to the price-based literature, for the measurement of the propagation of international food shocks.","Kyle","","No","","No","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","No","","Drop in export quantity","","Multiple","Yes","Statistical regression","Quantitative","Shock transmission","Global","National","1986-2011","N","","",56,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Multi-regional"

Seafood is the most traded food commodity and is globally important to human nutrition. The seafood production and trade system is exposed to a variety of disruptions including fishery collapses, natural disasters, oil spills, policy changes, and aquaculture disease outbreaks, aquafeed resource access and price spikes. The patterns and trends of these shocks to fisheries and aquaculture are poorly characterized and this limits the ability to generalize or predict responses to political, economic, and environmental changes. We applied a statistical shock detection approach to historic fisheries and aquaculture data to identify shocks over the period 1976-2011. A complementary case study approach was used to identify possible key social and political dynamics related to these shocks. The lack of a trend in the frequency or magnitude of the identified shocks and the range of identified causes suggest shocks are a common feature of these systems which occur due to a variety, and often multiple and simultaneous, causes. Shocks occurred most frequently in the Caribbean and Central America, the Middle East and North Africa, and South America, while the largest magnitude shocks occurred in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Shocks also occurred more frequently in aquaculture systems than in capture systems, particularly in recent years. In response to shocks, countries tend to increase imports and experience decreases in supply. The specific combination of changes in trade and supply are context specific, which is highlighted through four case studies. Historical examples of shocks considered in this study can inform policy for responding to shocks and identify potential risks and opportunities to build resilience in the global food system.

The sequence of events that is modelled comprises a negative wheat supply shock and subsequent implementation of an export tax by a major net exporter and a reduction in import tariffs by a small importer. The effects of trade policy responses are contrasted with those of full liberalisation of the wheat market. At the core are the (opposite) effects on producers and consumers, as well as the terms of-trade and trade tax revenue effects. Food security is shown to depend crucially on changes in prices but also in incomes that are associated with changes in factor returns. The results reveal that major net exporters are generally better off when implementing export taxes for food security purposes. Large exporting countries export price instability causing world food prices to rise further. Net importing countries lose out and have limited leeway to reduce tariffs or subsidise imports. Liberalising wheat trade mitigates rising prices and contributes to food security, but to the detriment of production in Africa and Asia, making them more dependent on and vulnerable to changes in the world market. Concerted action at the WTO forum is required, notably clarifying and sharpening the rules regarding export measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The method adopted was semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and semi-structured questionnaires. Findings - Thematic analysis shows that the major issues affecting communities' livelihood in the middle Zambezi river basin are related to frequent floods and droughts. Floods are due to heavy seasonal rainfall which occurs at the peak of the rainfall season. As for droughts, the frequency of dry-spells of 20 days on average has been observed during the crop season. The impacts of floods and droughts in the district, notably in some wards such as Kanyemba, are the reduction of crop production, food shortages, reduction of agriculture derived income and erosion of social network. Households have responded to these impacts through a number of coping mechanisms including disposal of assets, labour migration, stream bank and floodplain cultivation, piecework, remittance, wild production and fishing. However, such coping mechanisms are short term and some of them are in conflict with the country's environmental laws. Originality/value - This paper reports a study on the first such finding related to socioeconomic impact of floods and droughts on households located in the middle Zambezi valley which is 500 km from Harare with a specific focus on traditional coping strategies in the face of disasters.","Kyle","Original: Crops, livestock","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","","Floods, droughts","","Multiple","No","Interviews and focus groups","Qualitative","Livelihoods impacts","Zimbabwe","Sub-national","n/a","N","","",59,"Not specific","N","Africa"

These may include health care, education, clothing, food and housing. Despite its significance and contribution to the urban household food basket, UA in many SSA cities has not been integrated into urban development and planning policy. In addition to the absence of a supportive local government policy, over the last two decades UA has come under increasing pressure from extreme weather related events such as droughts and flooding. Drawing upon recent field-based research in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, the paper examines the relationships between UA and extreme weather conditions, and the impact on the livelihood options of urban poor.

Heat-wave-induced yield losses in Russia and resulting export restrictions led to increases in market prices for wheat across the Middle East, likely contributing to the Arab Spring. With ongoing climate change, temperatures and temperature variability will rise, leading to higher uncertainty in yields for major nutritional crops. Here we investigate which countries are most vulnerable to teleconnected supply-shocks, i.e. where diets strongly rely on the import of wheat, maize, or rice, and where a large share of the population is living in poverty. We find that the Middle East is most sensitive to teleconnected supply shocks in wheat, Central America to supply shocks in maize, and Western Africa to supply shocks in rice. Weighing with poverty levels, Sub-Saharan Africa is most affected. Altogether, a simultaneous 10% reduction in exports of wheat, rice, and maize would reduce caloric intake of 55 million people living in poverty by about 5%. Export bans in major producing regions would put up to 200 million people below the poverty line at risk, 90% of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our results suggest that a region-specific combination of national increases in agricultural productivity and diversification of trade partners and diets can effectively decrease future food security risks.","Kyle","","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","Reduced supply to international markets, export bans","","Simulated","Yes","Vulnerability indices and supply shock transmission model","Quantitative","Calorie supply dependence on imports and calorie reductions under simulated shocks","Global","International","n/a","N","","",62,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Multi-regional"

The study analyzed state-level relationships across the contiguous United States. States voluntarily report weekly human Salmonella cases to the Nationally Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. Representative weather conditions were created by population weighting temperature from the North American Land Data Assimilation System. Time series analysis using generalized additive models associated temperature against Salmonella infections while controlling for temporal patterns and the size of the population at risk. The study also investigated temperature and Salmonella infection transmission thresholds. In twenty-five states, higher weekly temperatures increased reported Salmonella infections. Each degree (degrees C) rise in temperature increased the risk of reporting a case by 1.3 to 5.9 percent. Many of these states were located in the Southwest, east central states, Midwest and Great Plains, and Northeast regions. Only temperatures above a state-specific threshold increased cases in four states. Above each threshold, a 1 degrees C temperature increase translated into 5.6 to 22.8 percent more cases.

The basin's economy and expanding agricultural sector are highly vulnerable to the impacts of rainfall shocks. A rainfall decrease scenario could lead to a 5% decline in the basin's GDP, with agricultural GDP standing to drop by as much as 10%. All sectors benefit from greater rainfall amounts.

This study was conducted to identify the food insecurity shocks and to estimate their effect based on the conceptual framework developed in Ethiopia, Amhara National Regional State of Libo Kemkem District. Descriptive statistical analysis, multiple regression, binary logistic regression, chi(2) and independent sample t-test were used as a data analysis technique. The results showed eight shocks affecting households which were weather variability, weed, plant insect and pest infestation, soil fertility problem, animal disease and epidemics, human disease and epidemics, price fluctuation problem and conflict. Weather variability, plant insect and pest infestation, weed, animal disease and epidemics created a mean loss of 3,821.38, 886.06, 508.04 and 1,418.32 Birr, respectively. In addition, human disease and epidemics, price fluctuation problem and conflict affected 68.11%, 88.11% and 14.59% of households, respectively.

However, the effect of climate variability and sudden shocks on resource availability through trade and its subsequent effect on population growth is largely unknown. Here we study the effect of resource variability and network topology on access to resources and population growth, using a model of population growth limited by resource availability in a trading network. Resources are redistributed in the network based on supply and the distance between nodes (i.e. cities or countries). Resources at nodes vary over time with wave parameters that mimic changes in biomass production arising from known climate variability. Random perturbations to resources are applied to study resilience of individual nodes and the system as a whole. The model demonstrates that redistribution of resources increases the maximum population that can be supported (carrying capacity) by the network. Fluctuations in carrying capacity depend on the amplitude and frequency of resource variability: fluctuations become larger for increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency. Our study shows that topology is the key factor determining the carrying capacity of a node. In larger networks the carrying capacity increases and the distribution of resources in the network becomes more equal. The most central nodes achieve a higher carrying capacity than nodes with a lower centrality. Moreover, central nodes are less susceptible to long-term resource variability and shocks. These insights can be used to understand how worldwide equitable access to resources can be maintained under increasing climate variability.","Kyle","","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","Climate variability, climate shock","","n/a","No","Small-world network model","Quantitative","Carrying capacity","n/a",NA,"n/a","N","","",67,"Not specific","N","Other"

To carry out this study, longitudinal panel data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey were used. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to assess the influence of these variables at the household, village, and regional levels over time. Results indicate that household location and its geographic setting, which correlate with amount of rainfall received, are the most important predictors of household food-security status. Time was another important predictor of food security, demonstrating a secular linear trend toward worse food-security status over time. Households that have irrigation demonstrated increased food security where there was also sufficient rainfall. According to the results of this study, social safety-net programs such as free-food distribution did not have an impact on food-security status. The results of this study point to a secular trend that food security in rural Ethiopia may be decreasing with time and that current safety-net programs and household assets may not be sufficient to prevent the decline.

This study examines one such relationship between the better known and most talked about climate anomaly, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the international prices of wheat, one of the most produced and consumed grain cereals in the world. The ENSO price relationship, moreover, is assumed to be characterized by nonlinear dynamics, because of the known asymmetric nature of ENSO cycles, as well as that of wheat prices. This study applies a vector smooth transition autoregressive (VSTAR) modeling framework to monthly spot prices of wheat from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Argentina, as well as the sea surface temperature anomalies from the Nino3.4 region, which serves as a proxy for the ENSO variable. Results show that, overall, wheat prices tend to increase after La Nina events, and decrease after El Nino events. The regime-dependent dynamics are apparent with more amplified price responses after La Nina shocks, and with more persistent price responses during the La Nina conditions. This is consistent with the economics of storage, wherein shocks related to expected supply and demand are known to have a more pronounced effect in a low-inventory regime. Findings of this study have strong implications for development economics, as they point to an additional channel of adversity due to the ENSO-related climate shocks. Moreover, the ENSO-induced price fluctuations are likely to affect the dynamics of international food and cash programs during extreme episodes of this climate anomaly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Widespread flooding cut roads and highways, isolated towns, and resulted in the deaths of people and animals. Farmlands were inundated and there were food shortages in many towns. We found clear evidence that the supermarket-based (long) food chain delivery system experienced significant difficulties in supplying food to flood-affected towns. In contrast, more localized (short) food supply chains-which relied upon supply from growers in peri-urban areas and community-based food initiatives-remained largely intact, and provided food at a time when the supermarkets were limited in their ability to respond to consumer demand. However, on closer examination of food distribution during flooding in the regional city of Rockhampton and in the State capital, Brisbane, the demarcation of success between ""long"" and ""short"" food chains became blurred. Both types of food supply chains shared some key resilience characteristics in responding to crisis but diverged in other important ways. We argue that conceptualizing food chains in terms of key elements of resilience-scale, diversity, flexibility and cohesion-may be more fruitful than the short-long dichotomy alone.

Evidence of climate change impacts are largely documented for crops with much less information for livestock. In this study we assessed smallholders' risk perceptions of climate change impacts on water buffalo production systems in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. Results from a household survey with 310 water buffalo farmers revealed that they are highly aware of climate change to which they ascribed to an increasing frequency of extreme events such as extreme rainfall, floods, typhoons and extreme heat. Perceptions of climate change risks strongly depended on the level of exposure and vulnerability to these extreme events. Feed availability and animal health were identified as the production aspects most severely affected by the multiple weather extremes, posing productivity risks and compelling farmers to adapt. Adaptation measures in the study area have been spontaneous and based on economic drivers rather than planned. These measures included biophysical and farm operational adjustments such as relocation of animals, adjusting forage planting times, use of crop residues, and shifting from rice cropping to buffalo dairying after recurring rice harvest failures. We suggest that there is a need for development of specific and longer-term adaptation measures that are planned to fit the water buffalo sector.","Kyle","","Yes","","Yes","","No","","Yes","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","Extreme events","(typhoons, floods, droughts, extreme rainfall, extreme heat and changing seasonal patterns)","2005-2015","No","Household questionnaire","Qualitative","Production and livelihoods","Philippines","Sub-national","2016","N","","",77,"Poultry, Pork & Other meat","N","Asia"

Using panel data, this paper analyzes the effect of rainfall shocks on Ethiopian rural households' food security and vulnerability over time while controlling for a range of other factors. To this end, we generate a time-variant household food security index which is developed by principal components analysis. Based on this index, households are classified into relative food security groups and their socioeconomic differences are assessed. The exploratory results show that compared to the less secured households, the more secured ones have male and literate household heads, tend to have a greater number of economically active household members, own more livestock, experience better rainfall outcome, and participate in local savings groups. Using the food security index as the dependent variable, we use a fixed effects instrumental variable regression model to identify determinants of households' food security over time and find that rainfall variability is an important factor. Moreover, household size, participation in local savings groups, and livestock ownership positively affect food security. Results from multinomial logistic regression model complement the fixed effects instrumental variable regression results by showing that the level and variability of rainfall are important determinants of persistent food insecurity and vulnerability. The results highlight the need for efficient risk reduction and mitigation programs to improve risk exposure and coping ability of rural households. Careful promotion of investment in infrastructure to support irrigation and water resources development is one aspect worth considering.","Kyle","","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","Rainfall shocks","","n/a","No","Household questionnaire / Regression modelling","Mixed","Food security","Ethiopia","Sub-national","1994-2004","N","","",78,"Not specific","N","Africa"

Cereal demand and interest rate shocks combined with low stocks affect intra-annual volatility, while other explanatory factors include exchange rate and crude oil price shocks.

Countries that are nutritionally or economically dependent on international trade of a commodity may be adversely affected by such shocks. While exposure to shocks has been studied in financial markets, communication networks, and some infrastructure systems, it has received less attention in food-trade networks. Here, we develop a forward shock-propagation model to quantify how trade flows are redistributed under a range of shock scenarios and assess the food-security outcomes by comparing changes in national fish supplies to indices of each country's nutritional fish dependency. Shock propagation and distribution among regions are modeled on a network of historical bilateral seafood trade data from UN Comtrade using 205 reporting territories grouped into 18 regions. In our model exposure to shocks increases with total imports and the number of import partners. We find that Central and West Africa are the most vulnerable to shocks, with their vulnerability increasing when a willingness-to-pay proxy is included. These findings suggest that countries can reduce their overall vulnerability to shocks by reducing reliance on imports and diversifying food sources. As international seafood trade grows, identifying these types of potential risks and vulnerabilities is important to build a more resilient food system.","Kyle","","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","No","","Simulated","","n/a","No","Shock-propagation model","Quantative","Vulnerability to shocks","Global","International","2011","N","","",80,"Seafood","N","Multi-regional"

This paper uses temporally and spatially disaggregated weather data and three waves of household panel survey data to understand the impact of weather extremes -including periods of high and low rainfall, heat, and wind- on household welfare. Particular attention is paid to heterogeneous effects across agro-ecological regions. We find that all types of extreme weather affect household well-being, although effects sometimes differ for income and calorie estimates. Periods of drought are the most consistently negative weather shock across various regions. An examination of the channels through which weather affects welfare reveals that drought conditions reduce income from both on- and off-farm sources, though households compensate for diminished on-farm production with food purchases. The paper further explores the household and community characteristics that mitigate the adverse effects of drought. In particular, access to credit and a more diverse income base seem to render a household more resilient.","Kyle","Original: Crops, livestock","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","","high/low rainfall, heat, wind","","n/a","No","Econometric approach","Quantative","Household welfare (income and calories)","Kenya","Sub-national","2000-2007","N","","",82,"Not specific","N","Africa"

We study the impacts of a FMD outbreak including the culling infected animals, a temporary decline in demand, and restrictions on movements of live animals and meats during the FMD outbreak period. Our results show that economic losses following this disease are spread over many periods even with a one-time shock. We also find that the impacts on the various primary sectors and downstream food sectors are quite different, depending on their initial trade position.

Here we use annual staple food production and trade data from 1992-2009 to analyse the changing properties of the global food system. Over the 18 year study period, we show that the global food system is relatively homogeneous (85% of countries have low or marginal food self-sufficiency) and increases in complexity, with the number of global wheat and rice trade connections doubling and trade flows increasing by 42 and 90%, respectively. The increased connectivity and flows within these global trade networks suggest that the global food system is vulnerable to systemic disruptions, especially considering the tendency for exporting countries to switch to non-exporting states during times of food scarcity in the global markets. To test this hypothesis, we superimpose continental-scale disruptions on the wheat and rice trade networks. We find greater absolute reductions in global wheat and rice exports along with larger losses in network connectivity as the networks evolve due to disruptions in European wheat and Asian rice production. Importantly, our findings indicate that least developed countries suffer greater import losses in more connected networks through their increased dependence on imports for staple foods (due to these large-scale disturbances): mean (median) wheat losses as percentages of staple food supply are 8.9% (3.8%) for 1992-1996, increasing to 11% (5.7%) for 2005-2009. Over the same intervals, rice losses increase from 8.2% (2.2%) to 14% (5.2%).

Many studies have analyzed agricultural market instability from different points of view, but the effect of climate oscillations on agricultural price volatility has been little studied. Climate anomalies, and in particular extreme events, can alter agricultural yields and stocks with related effects on prices. This paper presents a Volatility Impulse Response Function (VIRF) from a multivariate GARCH model to investigate the effects of variability in climatic shocks (El Nino/Southern Oscillation - ENSO) on international maize and soybean price volatility from 1960 to 2014. For both commodities, VIRF analysis was conducted splitting the effect of El Nino and La Nina events according to Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter meteorological seasons. Both events increase expected price volatility of maize, showing the strongest impact during the El Nino phase in Spring-Summer. Soybean price volatility tends to slightly decrease during Autumn-Winter meteorological seasons and to increase during the Spring-Summer period. To minimize the impact of ENSO events on commodity price volatility, various measures can be taken, both political and technical. Financial aspects should also be considered. It is possible that financial agents can use the ENSO index as information for trading activity, creating a new link between this index and volatility in commodity prices.","Jessica","","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","El Nino","","Multiple (ENSO years)","N","Time series econometric approach to looking at ENSO event impacts on price volatility","Quantitative","Price volatility","Global","International","1960-2014","N","","",9,"Legumes & nuts","N","Multi-regional"

Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate- related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries - fisheries, agriculture and mining - that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices - evenness, resilience, continuity of supply and climate resilience - to estimate the performance of simple and complex supply chains in each industry. As with ecological systems, we show that complex supply chains with a large number of nodes and links are more resilient to disruption. Critically, all chains, regardless of their complexity, will have diminished resilience as climate disruptions become more frequent. This highlights the importance of considering the broader economic benefits of diversified chains, leading to risk reduction and improved design post-disruption. It also reinforces the importance of a systems approach to risk management in supply chains, particularly in considering adaptation options for addressing direct and indirect impacts on. the chain as well as the global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Jessica","","No","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","No",NA,"Yes","","Yes","","No","","Hypothetical","","n/a","Y","Map supply chains and simulate effects of shocks on them","Mixed","Resilience score","Australia","National","","N","","",10,"Seafood","N","Oceania"

A previous study, focused on Niamey (Niger) with 'hunger' and 'normal' seasons modelled as a latent Markov process, found that in the last two decades the risk of food crises has tended to spread over longer periods and to shift forward in timing. To help better devise support programmes, it would be beneficial to test for this finding in other locations in Africa and extend the focus beyond conditional mean analysis. This paper first reviews measures of food insecurity/crisis risk, and considers determinants of spatial and temporal food price variability in drought-prone countries. Duration-dependent Markov-switching VAR models are then formulated and applied to monthly staple prices of food markets in Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia. This is complemented with multivariate GARCH models of volatility and dynamic correlations of food price shocks in major urban centres of five Sahel countries. In Niger, seasonal shocks in surplus-producing regions often anticipate by nearly 1 month those in deficit regions. 'Steep' regime probability switches are of concern especially in recent years. However, across semi-arid countries in East and West Africa, no systematic variation over time was detected in terms of onset and length of seasonal food insecurity periods, nor between seasons relative to food price volatility.","Jessica","Original items: Staple crops; crops listed in 'Food Item(s)' were those staple crops mentioned in the study text","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","Drought","","n/a","N","Time series econometric approach","Quantitative","Seasonal impact on staple crop price","Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia","National","1990-2010","N","","Kyle requested and emailed pdf",14,"Other cereals","N","Africa"

We studied the role of autonomous adaptation by farmers and through markets as embodied in a computable general equilibrium model. The results show that observed extreme impacts of precipitation on crop harvests are not serious for China at national level. The maize harvest is the most negatively affected with a reduction of 4 % without adaptation and less than 1 % reduction with adaptation. However, the impacts within a province may be serious and even become worse with adaptation. Good harvests might not make farmers better off due to lower crop prices even though consumers benefit.

However, during the last decade the availability of RUK grain exports was repeatedly diminished by harvest failures and further reduced by the introduction of export restrictions. By simulating a reoccurrence of the 2010 RUK harvest situation this paper assesses the impact of grain harvest failures and subsequent temporary export restrictions (bans, quotas, taxes) on national and international food security, specifically quantifying the effects on agricultural market prices and quantities. For the analysis AGLINK-COSIMO, a recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model, has been employed. Simulation results highlight the importance of RUK's grain production for world markets and global food security, indicating substantial price increases due to limited grain exports from RUK. Moreover, scenario results illustrate that temporary RUK export restrictions can considerably aggravate the situation on world grain markets, with particularly adverse effects for grain net importing countries. At the same time, results show that for a country like Ukraine, i.e. a country usually exporting large shares of its total grain production, the introduction of export restrictions could potentially result in decreases of domestic consumer prices to a level even below a situation with normal weather conditions. The results put international trade policy into focus and underline the necessity of greater cooperation on the part of exporting countries in order to avoid importing countries being denied necessary grain supplies.","Shauna","Original: Cereals (wheat, course grains)","Yes","feed","Yes","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","Drought","","2015","Yes","A recursive-dynamic, partial equilibrium, supply-demand model simulating the reoccurence of the 2010 RUK harvest failures","Quantitative","Grain availability, price and food security","Russia, Ukraine and Khazakstan","International","2011-2021","N","","Examines different policy scenarios of export bans, taxes, etc.",34,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Europe"

The impact of these spikes in world food prices on local food prices and thus on local consumers is determined by the food price pass through. Pass through is defined as the extent to which changes in world food prices lead to changes in local food prices. We examine the determinants of variation in food price pass through from global to local consumer prices in a global sample of 147 countries, using FAO data on world food prices and ILO data on food prices for consumers. While market integration matters, our study finds that income per capita is the dominant factor explaining cross-country variation in pass through of food prices. We estimate an elasticity of about 0.3 of pass through with respect to income per capita. This means far greater price transmission of food price shocks at the commodity level to final consumers in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The implication is that future swings in world food prices will in particular jeopardize food security in poor countries. Trade policy measures of market integration also affect the pass through significantly, whereas infrastructure and geography measures play no significant role. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It also assesses the impacts of food price increases on various household groups. Taking the 2007-2008 global food crisis as an example, we show that prices for domestic grain products are highly correlated with world market prices. This is true both for products for which Ghana is highly import-dependent (e.g., rice) and the products for which Ghana is self-sufficient (e.g., maize). The econometric results also show that price transmission is high between regional producer markets and markets located in the country's largest cities, and the distance between producer and consumer markets and the size of consumer markets matter in explaining the price transmission. The welfare analysis for households as consumers shows that the effect of world food prices appears relatively modest for the country as a whole due to relatively diverse consumption patterns within country. However, the national average hides important regional differences, both between regions and within different income groups. We find that the poorest of the poor-particularly those living in the urban areas-are hardest hit by high food prices. The negative effect of the food crisis is particularly strong in northern Ghana. The main explanations for this regional variation in the price effect is the different consumption patterns and much lower per capita income levels in the North of Ghana compared to other regions in the country.

Based on this analysis, we suggest that Niger should develop a proper trade policy with its neighboring countries to facilitate regional market integration. This will enable Niger to import cereals from regional surplus-producing areas to supply its food shock regions to reduce the negative impacts of price shocks on households. For rice, Niger should encourage local production to limit high dependence on international markets.","Shauna","","No","","Yes","(talks about how production changes due to seasonality influence the prices)","No","","Yes","(mentions transportation)","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","No specific shock","","na","Yes","Cointegration models to analyze price transmissions using monthly wholesale prices from FAO","Quantitative","Price transmission","Niger","National","2006-2012","N","","Doesnt actually mention a shock or climate.

By applying the model to publicly-available data for the cereals commodity group over a 17 year period, we find that differential outcomes of supply shocks simulated through this time period are driven not only by the intensification of trade, but as importantly by changes in the distribution of reserves. Our analysis also identifies countries where trade dependency may accentuate the risk of food shortages from foreign production shocks; such risk could be reduced by increasing domestic reserves or importing food from a diversity of suppliers that possess their own reserves.

With ongoing climate change, temperatures and temperature variability will rise, leading to higher uncertainty in yields for major nutritional crops. Here we investigate which countries are most vulnerable to teleconnected supply-shocks, i.e. where diets strongly rely on the import of wheat, maize, or rice, and where a large share of the population is living in poverty. We find that the Middle East is most sensitive to teleconnected supply shocks in wheat, Central America to supply shocks in maize, and Western Africa to supply shocks in rice. Weighing with poverty levels, Sub-Saharan Africa is most affected. Altogether, a simultaneous 10% reduction in exports of wheat, rice, and maize would reduce caloric intake of 55 million people living in poverty by about 5%. Export bans in major producing regions would put up to 200 million people below the poverty line at risk, 90% of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The basin's economy and expanding agricultural sector are highly vulnerable to the impacts of rainfall shocks. A rainfall decrease scenario could lead to a 5% decline in the basin's GDP, with agricultural GDP standing to drop by as much as 10%. All sectors benefit from greater rainfall amounts.

Yet rainfall is not the sole determinant of farm enterprise profitability; prices of farm inputs and commodities produced also affect farm profits. This study draws on farm commodity prices and input prices from the past 9 years to form correlated price and cost datasets that are then used in examining the profitability of a range of farm enterprises in south eastern Australia under low, average and high rainfall scenarios. Fourteen representative farm enterprises were examined that included the production of Merino fine wool, prime lamb, beef cattle, milk, wheat and canola. The spread of profitability of these farm enterprises against the backdrop of price variability and rainfall scenarios was compared. The results show that profitability of the enterprises studied is currently affected more by changes in rainfall than by commodity prices and that dairy enterprises are the most profitable on a $/ha basis but that the profitability of wheat, steer and prime lamb enterprises are least affected by low rainfall scenarios. The self-replacing cow-calf beef systems, canola and dairy enterprises are the most vulnerable to reduced rainfall and may benefit by reducing profit risk through changes such as expanding the enterprise or diversifying across other types of enterprises. Farm diversification involving combinations of enterprises with negatively correlated profits will enable the variance in farm profits to be reduced. Such actions could form part of farms' adaptation strategies to climate and price variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We study the impacts of a FMD outbreak including the culling infected animals, a temporary decline in demand, and restrictions on movements of live animals and meats during the FMD outbreak period. Our results show that economic losses following this disease are spread over many periods even with a one-time shock. We also find that the impacts on the various primary sectors and downstream food sectors are quite different, depending on their initial trade position.

Too often, business learns from experience if and how their supply chains can withstand and recover from climate shocks with little insight on proactively developing climate resilient supply chains. We use a network-based simulation approach to estimate the resilience of supply chains, particularly to disruption experienced during climate- related extreme events. We consider supply chain examples from three Australian resource industries - fisheries, agriculture and mining - that have experienced climate shocks in recent years. We derive four supply chain indices - evenness, resilience, continuity of supply and climate resilience - to estimate the performance of simple and complex supply chains in each industry. As with ecological systems, we show that complex supply chains with a large number of nodes and links are more resilient to disruption. Critically, all chains, regardless of their complexity, will have diminished resilience as climate disruptions become more frequent. This highlights the importance of considering the broader economic benefits of diversified chains, leading to risk reduction and improved design post-disruption. It also reinforces the importance of a systems approach to risk management in supply chains, particularly in considering adaptation options for addressing direct and indirect impacts on. the chain as well as the global challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Jessica","","No","","Yes","","Yes","","Yes","","No",NA,"Yes","","Yes","","No","","Hypothetical","","n/a","Y","Map supply chains and simulate effects of shocks on them","Mixed","Resilience score","Australia","National","","N","","",10,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Oceania"

A previous study, focused on Niamey (Niger) with 'hunger' and 'normal' seasons modelled as a latent Markov process, found that in the last two decades the risk of food crises has tended to spread over longer periods and to shift forward in timing. To help better devise support programmes, it would be beneficial to test for this finding in other locations in Africa and extend the focus beyond conditional mean analysis. This paper first reviews measures of food insecurity/crisis risk, and considers determinants of spatial and temporal food price variability in drought-prone countries. Duration-dependent Markov-switching VAR models are then formulated and applied to monthly staple prices of food markets in Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia. This is complemented with multivariate GARCH models of volatility and dynamic correlations of food price shocks in major urban centres of five Sahel countries. In Niger, seasonal shocks in surplus-producing regions often anticipate by nearly 1 month those in deficit regions. 'Steep' regime probability switches are of concern especially in recent years. However, across semi-arid countries in East and West Africa, no systematic variation over time was detected in terms of onset and length of seasonal food insecurity periods, nor between seasons relative to food price volatility.","Jessica","Original items: Staple crops; crops listed in 'Food Item(s)' were those staple crops mentioned in the study text","No","","No","","No","","No","","No",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","Drought","","n/a","N","Time series econometric approach","Quantitative","Seasonal impact on staple crop price","Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia","National","1990-2010","N","","Kyle requested and emailed pdf",14,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Africa"

We studied the role of autonomous adaptation by farmers and through markets as embodied in a computable general equilibrium model. The results show that observed extreme impacts of precipitation on crop harvests are not serious for China at national level. The maize harvest is the most negatively affected with a reduction of 4 % without adaptation and less than 1 % reduction with adaptation. However, the impacts within a province may be serious and even become worse with adaptation. Good harvests might not make farmers better off due to lower crop prices even though consumers benefit.

Pass through is defined as the extent to which changes in world food prices lead to changes in local food prices. We examine the determinants of variation in food price pass through from global to local consumer prices in a global sample of 147 countries, using FAO data on world food prices and ILO data on food prices for consumers. While market integration matters, our study finds that income per capita is the dominant factor explaining cross-country variation in pass through of food prices. We estimate an elasticity of about 0.3 of pass through with respect to income per capita. This means far greater price transmission of food price shocks at the commodity level to final consumers in low-income countries than in high-income countries. The implication is that future swings in world food prices will in particular jeopardize food security in poor countries.

It also assesses the impacts of food price increases on various household groups. Taking the 2007-2008 global food crisis as an example, we show that prices for domestic grain products are highly correlated with world market prices. This is true both for products for which Ghana is highly import-dependent (e.g., rice) and the products for which Ghana is self-sufficient (e.g., maize). The econometric results also show that price transmission is high between regional producer markets and markets located in the country's largest cities, and the distance between producer and consumer markets and the size of consumer markets matter in explaining the price transmission. The welfare analysis for households as consumers shows that the effect of world food prices appears relatively modest for the country as a whole due to relatively diverse consumption patterns within country. However, the national average hides important regional differences, both between regions and within different income groups. We find that the poorest of the poor-particularly those living in the urban areas-are hardest hit by high food prices. The negative effect of the food crisis is particularly strong in northern Ghana. The main explanations for this regional variation in the price effect is the different consumption patterns and much lower per capita income levels in the North of Ghana compared to other regions in the country.

Here we investigate which countries are most vulnerable to teleconnected supply-shocks, i.e. where diets strongly rely on the import of wheat, maize, or rice, and where a large share of the population is living in poverty. We find that the Middle East is most sensitive to teleconnected supply shocks in wheat, Central America to supply shocks in maize, and Western Africa to supply shocks in rice. Weighing with poverty levels, Sub-Saharan Africa is most affected. Altogether, a simultaneous 10% reduction in exports of wheat, rice, and maize would reduce caloric intake of 55 million people living in poverty by about 5%. Export bans in major producing regions would put up to 200 million people below the poverty line at risk, 90% of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our results suggest that a region-specific combination of national increases in agricultural productivity and diversification of trade partners and diets can effectively decrease future food security risks.","Kyle","","No","","Yes","","No","","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","No","","Reduced supply to international markets, export bans","","Simulated","Yes","Vulnerability indices and supply shock transmission model","Quantitative","Calorie supply dependence on imports and calorie reductions under simulated shocks","Global","International","n/a","N","","",62,"Maize, Wheat & Rice","N","Multi-regional"

The basin's economy and expanding agricultural sector are highly vulnerable to the impacts of rainfall shocks. A rainfall decrease scenario could lead to a 5% decline in the basin's GDP, with agricultural GDP standing to drop by as much as 10%. All sectors benefit from greater rainfall amounts.

Yet rainfall is not the sole determinant of farm enterprise profitability; prices of farm inputs and commodities produced also affect farm profits. This study draws on farm commodity prices and input prices from the past 9 years to form correlated price and cost datasets that are then used in examining the profitability of a range of farm enterprises in south eastern Australia under low, average and high rainfall scenarios. Fourteen representative farm enterprises were examined that included the production of Merino fine wool, prime lamb, beef cattle, milk, wheat and canola. The spread of profitability of these farm enterprises against the backdrop of price variability and rainfall scenarios was compared. The results show that profitability of the enterprises studied is currently affected more by changes in rainfall than by commodity prices and that dairy enterprises are the most profitable on a $/ha basis but that the profitability of wheat, steer and prime lamb enterprises are least affected by low rainfall scenarios. The self-replacing cow-calf beef systems, canola and dairy enterprises are the most vulnerable to reduced rainfall and may benefit by reducing profit risk through changes such as expanding the enterprise or diversifying across other types of enterprises. Farm diversification involving combinations of enterprises with negatively correlated profits will enable the variance in farm profits to be reduced. Such actions could form part of farms' adaptation strategies to climate and price variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To help better devise support programmes, it would be beneficial to test for this finding in other locations in Africa and extend the focus beyond conditional mean analysis. This paper first reviews measures of food insecurity/crisis risk, and considers determinants of spatial and temporal food price variability in drought-prone countries. Duration-dependent Markov-switching VAR models are then formulated and applied to monthly staple prices of food markets in Niger, Ethiopia and Somalia. This is complemented with multivariate GARCH models of volatility and dynamic correlations of food price shocks in major urban centres of five Sahel countries. In Niger, seasonal shocks in surplus-producing regions often anticipate by nearly 1 month those in deficit regions. 'Steep' regime probability switches are of concern especially in recent years.

It also assesses the impacts of food price increases on various household groups. Taking the 2007-2008 global food crisis as an example, we show that prices for domestic grain products are highly correlated with world market prices. This is true both for products for which Ghana is highly import-dependent (e.g., rice) and the products for which Ghana is self-sufficient (e.g., maize). The econometric results also show that price transmission is high between regional producer markets and markets located in the country's largest cities, and the distance between producer and consumer markets and the size of consumer markets matter in explaining the price transmission. The welfare analysis for households as consumers shows that the effect of world food prices appears relatively modest for the country as a whole due to relatively diverse consumption patterns within country. However, the national average hides important regional differences, both between regions and within different income groups. We find that the poorest of the poor-particularly those living in the urban areas-are hardest hit by high food prices. The negative effect of the food crisis is particularly strong in northern Ghana. The main explanations for this regional variation in the price effect is the different consumption patterns and much lower per capita income levels in the North of Ghana compared to other regions in the country.

Cointegration and error correction models were employed to analyze the degree of price transmission. Tests of causality were also performed. In general, the results showed that grain markets in Niger respond to negative and positive shocks in regional and international markets differently. Maize and rice markets have high speed of adjustments to world prices compared to millet and sorghum markets. The speed of adjustment of prices to the long-run equilibrium varies between 30 percent, 35 percent, 48 percent and 40 percent respectively for millet, sorghum, maize and rice prices. Nigeria, Burkina-Faso, Mali, Togo and Vietnam markets have shown significant transmission in Niger markets. Supply and demand shocks in these markets will definitely affect Niger food prices. Based on this analysis, we suggest that Niger should develop a proper trade policy with its neighboring countries to facilitate regional market integration. This will enable Niger to import cereals from regional surplus-producing areas to supply its food shock regions to reduce the negative impacts of price shocks on households. For rice, Niger should encourage local production to limit high dependence on international markets.","Shauna","","No","","Yes","(talks about how production changes due to seasonality influence the prices)","No","","Yes","(mentions transportation)","Yes",NA,"No","","No","","Yes","","No specific shock","","na","Yes","Cointegration models to analyze price transmissions using monthly wholesale prices from FAO","Quantitative","Price transmission","Niger","National","2006-2012","N","","Doesnt actually mention a shock or climate.

This paper introduces a model that simulates the short-term response to a food supply shock originating in a single country, which is partly absorbed through decreases in domestic reserves and consumption, and partly transmitted through the adjustment of trade flows. By applying the model to publicly-available data for the cereals commodity group over a 17 year period, we find that differential outcomes of supply shocks simulated through this time period are driven not only by the intensification of trade, but as importantly by changes in the distribution of reserves. Our analysis also identifies countries where trade dependency may accentuate the risk of food shortages from foreign production shocks; such risk could be reduced by increasing domestic reserves or importing food from a diversity of suppliers that possess their own reserves. This simulation-based model provides a framework to study the short-term, nonlinear and out-of-equilibrium response of trade networks to supply shocks, and could be applied to specific scenarios of environmental or economic perturbations.","Shauna","Original: Cereals and cereal products","No","","Yes","","Yes","(reserves)","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","Indirectly (check with Jessica)","Simulate a shock","Production shock (20%)","na","Yes","Model simulating the impact of a shock of a specific food commodity to global trade to examine tapping into reserves using historical data on the international trade of cereals","Quantitative","Transmission of shock through trade networks","Global","International","1994-2011","N","","No mention of climate",52,"Other cereals","N","Multi-regional"

Numerous arguments have been proposed to explain overshooting, including financial speculation, depreciation of the United States (US) dollar, low interest rates, and reductions in grain stocks. However, observations that international rice prices surged in response to export restrictions by India and Vietnam suggested that trade-related factors could be an important basis for overshooting, especially given the very tangible link between export volumes and export prices. In this paper, we revisit the trade story by closely examining monthly data from Thailand (the largest exporter of rice), and the United States (the largest exporter of wheat and maize and the third largest exporter of soybeans). In all cases except soybeans, we find that large surges in export volumes preceded the price surges. The presence of these large demand surges, together with back-of-the-envelope estimates of their price impacts, suggests that trade events played a much larger and more pervasive role than previously thought.

Yet rainfall is not the sole determinant of farm enterprise profitability; prices of farm inputs and commodities produced also affect farm profits. This study draws on farm commodity prices and input prices from the past 9 years to form correlated price and cost datasets that are then used in examining the profitability of a range of farm enterprises in south eastern Australia under low, average and high rainfall scenarios. Fourteen representative farm enterprises were examined that included the production of Merino fine wool, prime lamb, beef cattle, milk, wheat and canola. The spread of profitability of these farm enterprises against the backdrop of price variability and rainfall scenarios was compared. The results show that profitability of the enterprises studied is currently affected more by changes in rainfall than by commodity prices and that dairy enterprises are the most profitable on a $/ha basis but that the profitability of wheat, steer and prime lamb enterprises are least affected by low rainfall scenarios. The self-replacing cow-calf beef systems, canola and dairy enterprises are the most vulnerable to reduced rainfall and may benefit by reducing profit risk through changes such as expanding the enterprise or diversifying across other types of enterprises. Farm diversification involving combinations of enterprises with negatively correlated profits will enable the variance in farm profits to be reduced. Such actions could form part of farms' adaptation strategies to climate and price variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper introduces a model that simulates the short-term response to a food supply shock originating in a single country, which is partly absorbed through decreases in domestic reserves and consumption, and partly transmitted through the adjustment of trade flows. By applying the model to publicly-available data for the cereals commodity group over a 17 year period, we find that differential outcomes of supply shocks simulated through this time period are driven not only by the intensification of trade, but as importantly by changes in the distribution of reserves. Our analysis also identifies countries where trade dependency may accentuate the risk of food shortages from foreign production shocks; such risk could be reduced by increasing domestic reserves or importing food from a diversity of suppliers that possess their own reserves. This simulation-based model provides a framework to study the short-term, nonlinear and out-of-equilibrium response of trade networks to supply shocks, and could be applied to specific scenarios of environmental or economic perturbations.","Shauna","Original: Cereals and cereal products","No","","Yes","","Yes","(reserves)","No","","Yes",NA,"No","","Yes","","Yes","Indirectly (check with Jessica)","Simulate a shock","Production shock (20%)","na","Yes","Model simulating the impact of a shock of a specific food commodity to global trade to examine tapping into reserves using historical data on the international trade of cereals","Quantitative","Transmission of shock through trade networks","Global","International","1994-2011","N","","No mention of climate",52,"Other cereals","N","Multi-regional"
